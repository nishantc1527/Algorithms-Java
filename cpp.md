# C++ Users

There is a MakeFile for every C++ section. All testing is done with Google Test. You don't need to download Google Test yourself.

# Running Files Without CMake

To compile a file, use this command:

    g++ <path-to-file> -o out
    
You can replace ```out``` with whatever you want, and you can even delete the whole ```-o out``` part. If you choose to delete ```-o out```,
then you have to do the next step differently.

Run the newly made exe file with this:

    ./out
    
If you replaced ```out``` with something else, replace it here to. If you didn't add the ```-o out``` part, replace it with this:

    ./a
