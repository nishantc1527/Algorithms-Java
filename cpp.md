# C++ Users

There is a MakeFile for every C++ section. All testing is done with Google Test. You don't need to download Google Test yourself.

# Running Files With CMake (Recommended)

Go to the directory with the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Then make the CMake output directory using this:

    mkdir cmake-build-debug # you can call it whatever you want, but this name is git-ignored
    cd cmake-build-debug
    
Then run the CMake.

    cmake ../
    cmake --build .
    
Then run the CMake project.

    ./Algorithms

# Running Files Without CMake

Note that without CMake, you can't run tests.

To compile a file, use this command:

    g++ <path-to-file> -o out
    
You can replace ```out``` with whatever you want, and you can even delete the whole ```-o out``` part. If you choose to delete ```-o out```,
then you have to do the next step differently.

Run the newly made exe file with this:

    ./out
    
If you replaced ```out``` with something else, replace it here to. If you didn't add the ```-o out``` part, replace it with this:

    ./a
